## Inspiration âš¡_

All of the social media platforms that we have right now are fundamentally flawed, because they all rely on advertising as an optimization function, i.e the machine learning algorithms working underneath them are trying to maximize the time spent by a user on that platform by showing them either content that they love or the content they hate. 
## What it does ðŸ¤–
a Social media platform that would reward the self awareness of the users who are willing to put in the work of making the platform a place of fruitful discussions and **positive conversations**,while also motivating the ones in need. 
So, instead of people competing for likes and retweets weâ€™d have people whoâ€™d compete for helping others through positive and informative posts and in turn theyâ€™d get rewards for doing so.
- provide people with much needed positivity which would help society's unstated needs.
- act as a discussion place for people who are passionate about something and wanna express their thoughts without the fear of being judged.

## Features

> created a Rewards section for the user to commend them for being self aware and promoting fruitful discussions among others.
> The rewards section can be used by the users to convert the tokens that they have earned to coupons, which they can then use on other platforms to avail exciting discounts.


## How We built it ðŸ’¡
- The website UI/UX was designed using Figma and then developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.flask was used to detect the sentiment of text.
- We used **_vendarsentiment_** to detect the sentiment of the text.
 


Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Gulp] - the streaming build system
- [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML
to Markdown converter
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.



## Development


#### Accomplishments that we are proud of ðŸ˜Œ
We created a completely functional application, which can make a small difference in in our everyday health. We successfully made the applicaition which easly interact with text sentiment of the user, We are proud that we could shape our idea into a functioning application which can be used by any user!

## What's next for Lazurus.com ðŸ“ˆ
Later, we have planned that weâ€™ll add many more features to the product such as 

> Membership option :- The membership option won't be a paid one but itâ€™ll have to be earned by doing something really extraordinary for the community. On becoming a member someone could expect even better rewards.

> Circles : We have planned to create  â€˜Circlesâ€™ which are small communities of anonymous people who have similar tastes and wanna have  discussions on specific topics.. For example: There could be a circle for â€˜Movie discussionsâ€™ , â€˜Book discussionsâ€™ ,  and just about anything from â€˜Footballâ€™ to â€˜Foodâ€™ .

> News: Include an unbiased news section which would show both sides of any story. So that people could break out of their own bubble which is full of biased thoughts that social media has put into them over the years..

> Revival : This would provide a way for people who have been flagged for three times to redeem themselves of their actions by doing something really huge.

> Building upon our Reward system and including much more than just coupons.
